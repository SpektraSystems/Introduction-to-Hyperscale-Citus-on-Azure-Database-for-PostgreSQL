# Getting started with Hyperscale(Citus)

Hyperscale(Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL service uses a firewall at the server-level. By default, the firewall prevents all external applications and tools from connecting to the coordinator node and any databases inside. 

We must add a rule to open the firewall for a specific IP address range.
On the Overview pane in the upper right you will see the address of the coordinator hostname for the cluster that you will be connecting to.

## **Lab 3: Configure a server-level firewall rule**

1. Go to **Home** and select **postgresXXXX**, On the left side navigation of the overview pane under **Settings** click **Networking**. For Firewall Rule Name enter **CloudShell**. Enter the IP address from your Cloud Shell in the **START IP** and **END IP** boxes.

Then click **Save** at the top left of the pane.

> **Note**: Hyperscale(Citus) server communicates over port 5432. If you are trying to connect from within a corporate network, outbound traffic over port 5432 may not be allowed by your network's firewall. If so, you cannot connect to your Hyperscale(Citus) server unless your IT department opens port 5432.
