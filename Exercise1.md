# Getting started with Hyperscale(Citus) extension for PostgreSQL

These instructions will instruct you on how to create a Hyperscale(Citus) server group using the Azure portal. Normally this takes about 10 minutes, however in the interest of time we have pre-created this for you. The following steps will take you through the process so you know how simple and easy it is but at the end we will just use the one already created.

## **Lab 1: Create a Hyperscale(Citus) on Azure Database for PostgreSQL**

Follow these steps to understand the process of creating a **PostgreSQL Hyperscale(Citus)** server group using the Azure portal:

1.Click **+ Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.

4.Fill out the new server details form with the following information:

- **Subscription**: will be defaulted to your session's subscription
- **Resource group**: From the dropdown select **citus-xxxx** that is your existing resource group.
- **Server group name**: Enter **postgresxxxx**, you can copy from the environment details tab.
- **Location**: Select location of your resource group. 
- **Compute + Storage**: Click **Configure server group**. Leave the settings in that section unchanged and click **Save**.
- **PostgreSQl version**: Leave Dafault 
- **Admin username**: currently required to be the value - **citus** 
- **Password**: Enter **Password.1!!** and same for **Confirm Password**.

> **Note**: When creating Hyperscale(Citus) deployments you are able to horizontally scale the number of worker nodes up to 20 nodes. If you need more than 20 nodes, just create a support ticket and we will enable that for you. You will be able to set up/down (vcores, storage) on all workers as well as the coordinator. RAM is a function of number of cores and type of server (controller or worker).

5.Click **Review + create** to see a summary. At this point **DO NOT click Create** as we have already created it for you to save time.

> **Note**: If you clicked create, it would take up to 10 minutes to deploy. You would be redirected to a page that monitors the deployment while you wait.

6.Now in the upper left of the Azure Portal click **Home**. Then under Azure services click **Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers**.
